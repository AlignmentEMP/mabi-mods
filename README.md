-- Align's custom-made mods for MabiPro --

All mods will be given in their appropriate folder heirarchy (so just drag and drop).
Pet AIs should go in your Mabinogi Pet AI folder, which is often found in My Documents.

When saving .dds files, save them in "B8G8R8A8 (Linear, A8R8G8B8)" format (using paint dot net, personally)

If assistance is needed, ping @Align in the MabiPro discord
