If itemdb.xml is causing you to crash, or if the pouches don't show their letters/icons, you probably need to unpack the most recent pack and extract a new itemdb.xml

Afterwards, search for each images name and change it to the appropriate name eg. change item_leather to item_leather1, item_leather2, item_leather3, item_leather4.

Take a look at the included itemdb.xml to see exactly how it has been changed (search for cheap leather and look at the parameter called "File_InvImage").

When saving the pictures (if u choose to edit them), they must be saved in "B8G8R8A8 (Linear, A8R8G8B8)" format (I use paint dot net)
