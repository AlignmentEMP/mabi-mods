This is a basis for making your own custom ego portrait.

For a thorough guide on how to do this, go here: https://mabimods.net/index.php?topic=15561

Basically, make your picture 512x512, leave a bit of space for eyes/mouth, clean em up nice, then edit the XML accordinly.

I suggest using paint dot net (https://www.getpaint.net/download.html#download) and
downloading Pyrochild's pack (https://forums.getpaint.net/topic/7291-pyrochild-plugins-2020-11-21/) for the glow outline (Object > Outline Object)

Ego portraits are located in data\gfx\image\npc
Ego XMLs are located in data\db\npc

Make sure you get both the high_ and normal versions of the ego portraits (they should be the same image, just copy and rename one to the other).
